## Modes

There three main modes of vim. Normal, Insert and Visual are key.

* Normal is the base mode of things. You will run commands through normal mode.
* Insert is where you can insert characters into a file
* Visual/visual block is where you can select/modify multiple lines


## Helpful commands

Every command is ran with `:` or the colon in normal mode.

1. quit: `q`
2. write: `w`
3. exit: `x`
4. force: `!` Ex (quit without saving): `:q!`
5. Search: `/`
6. Search and Replace: `%s/{regex}/{replacement}/{modifiers}`
